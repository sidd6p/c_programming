        "excerpt":"   Today, I came across a post on facebook which made me laugh so much. You can also have some good time seeing the below image.    The above picture clearly tells you how bad is taking run rate as a single factor to predict the final score in an limited overs cricket match.  In ODI and T-20 cricket, many factors play a key role in deciding what the final score will be.  Let’s look at some of the key factors:      Number of wickets left   Number of balls left   On how much scores are the current batsman batting?   How much the team had scored in last 5 overs?   How much the team had lost wickets in last 5 overs?   The nature of the pitch   How strong is the batting and bowling team?   I will use some of these factors to predict score using machine learning algorithms. We use regression analysis in machine   learning to predict the final score of an ODI or T-20 match.     Preparing the dataset   I have not scrapped the web pages to prepare the dataset. I have downloaded the dataset from cricsheet. The site gives us ball by ball details of matches. I then wrote a custom code to only include some of the features which I will be using.   The dataset contains ball by ball coverage of:      1188 ODI matches: data/odi.csv   1474 T-20 matches: data/t20.csv   617 IPL matches: data/ipl.csv   Each dataset consists of following columns(features):      mid: Each match is given a unique number   date: When the match happened   venue: Stadium where match is being played   bat_team: Batting team name   bowl_team: Bowling team name   batsman: Batsman name who faced that ball   bowler: Bowler who bowled that ball   runs: Total runs scored by team at that instance   wickets: Total wickets fallen at that instance   overs: Total overs bowled at that instance   runs_last_5: Total runs scored in last 5 overs   wickets_last_5: Total wickets that fell in last 5 overs   striker: max(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)   non-striker: min(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)   total: Total runs scored by batting team after first innings         Importing the dataset   import pandas as pd dataset = pd.read_csv('data/odi.csv') X = dataset.iloc[:,[7,8,9,12,13]].values #Input features y = dataset.iloc[:, 14].values #Label   I have used ‘odi.csv’ datafile here for predicting scores in ODI cricket. One can use ‘t20.csv’ or ‘ipl.csv’ if they want to predict scores of T-20 matches or IPL matches respectively.   Features Used:      runs   wickets   overs   striker   non-striker   Why didn’t I use other features?   While experimenting, all the other features didn’t make much difference in results. You can use a different combination of features and test the code on them.   Label Used: total   Splitting data into training and testing set   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 0)   We will train our model on 75 percent of the dataset and test the model on remaining dataset.   Feature Scaling the data   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler sc = StandardScaler() X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train) X_test = sc.transform(X_test)   Feature scaling is a very important part of machine learning. You can read more about it here      Training the dataset           Using Linear Regression Algorithm       from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression lin = LinearRegression() lin.fit(X_train,y_train)                Using Random Forest Regression Algorithm       from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor lin = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100,max_features=None) lin.fit(X_train,y_train)           You can use any one of these algorithms but as you will see later random forest regression gives us better accuracy.   Testing the dataset on trained model   y_pred = lin.predict(X_test) score = lin.score(X_test,y_test)*100 print(\"R-squared value:\" , score) print(\"Custom accuracy:\" , custom_accuracy(y_test,y_pred,20))   R-squared value   R-sqaured is a statistic that will give some information about the goodness of fit of a model. In regression, the R-squared coefficient of determination is a statistical measure of how well the regression predictions approximate the real data points. An R-squared value of 1 indicates that the regression predictions perfectly fit the data.   Custom accuracy   I have defined my own function to measure accuracy of model. Custom Accuracy is defined on the basis of difference between the predicted score and actual score. If this difference falls below a particular thresold, we count it as a correct prediction.   def custom_accuracy(y_test,y_pred,thresold):     right = 0     l = len(y_pred)     for i in range(0,l):         if(abs(y_pred[i]-y_test[i]) &lt;= thresold):             right += 1     return ((right/l)*100)   I have kept thresold as 20 for ODI matches and 10 for T-20 matches.         Testing with a custom input   import numpy as np new_prediction = lin.predict(sc.transform(np.array([[100,0,13,50,50]]))) print(\"Prediction score:\" , new_prediction)   Results           Linear Regression                                  Dataset           R-squared           Custom Accuracy                                           ODI           52           43                             T-20           52           44                             IPL           50           44                                Random Forest Regression                                  Dataset           R-squared           Custom Accuracy                                           ODI           79           77                             T-20           64           59                             IPL           67           65                           Code and dataset   https://github.com/codophobia/CricketScorePredictor       ","categories": ["python"],

        "title": "How to Win Friends and Influence People Part-1",
        "excerpt":"How to win friends and influence people is a famous book written by Dale Carnegie. Dale Carnegie was an American writer and lecturer, and the developer of famous courses in self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking, and interpersonal skills. He has written several books which focuses on self-improvement and interpersonal skills. One of the core ideas in his books is that it is possible to change other people’s behavior by changing one’s behavior toward them.   How to win friends and influence people includes the following parts:      Fundamental Techniques in Handling People   Six Ways to Make People Like You   How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking   Be a Leader – How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment   We will go through the first part in this blog and describe the principles one can adopt in his/her life to become good at handling people. I have included whatever I highlighted while I was reading this book.   In the first part, the author describes three principles on how to deal with handling people. Each principle is followed by numerous examples from real life. Since it’s just a summary, I would not be mentioning all the examples here.   Don’t criticize, condemn or complain.   When criminals don’t blame themselves then what about us!   Al Capone was an American Gangster who was known by the nickname “Scarface”. Crowley was sentenced to the electric chair. When he arrived at the death house in Sing Sing, did he say, “This is what I get for killing people”? No, he said: “This is what I get for defending myself.”     If Al Capone, “Two Gun” Crowley, Dutch Schultz, and the desperate men and women behind prison walls don’t blame themselves for anything – what about the people with whom you and I come in contact?       Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.       George B. Johnston of Enid, Oklahoma, is the safety coordinator for an engineering company. One of his responsibilities is to see that employees wear their hard hats whenever they are on the job in the field. He reported that whenever he came across workers who were not wearing hard hats, he would tell them with a lot of authority of the regulation and that they must comply. As a result he would get sullen acceptance, and often after he left, the workers would remove the hats. He decided to try a different approach. The next time he found some of the workers not wearing their hard hat, he asked if the hats were uncomfortable or did not fit properly. Then he reminded the men in a pleasant tone of voice that the hat was designed to protect them from injury and suggested that it always be worn on the job. The result was increased compliance with the regulation with no resentment or emotional upset.       Let’s realize that criticisms are like homing pigeons. They always return home. Let’s realize that the person we are going to correct and condemn will probably justify himself or herself, and condemn us in return; or, like the gentle Taft, will say: “I don’t see how I could have done any differently from what I have.    Before you criticize, think from other person’s perspective.   When George Meade didn’t follow Lincoln’s order during Battle of Gettysburg.      The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first three days of July 1863. During the night of July 4, Lee began to retreat southward while storm clouds deluged the country with rain. When Lee reached the Potomac with his defeated army, he found a swollen, impassable river in front of him, and a victorious Union Army behind him. Lee was in a trap. He couldn’t escape. Lincoln saw that. Here was a golden, heaven-sent opportunity – the opportunity to capture Lee’s army and end the war immediately. So, with a surge of high hope, Lincoln ordered Meade not to call a council of war but to attack Lee immediately. Lincoln telegraphed his orders and then sent a special messenger messenger to Meade demanding immediate action.    But Meade did just the opposite of what Lincoln has ordered him and Lee was able to escape. This made Lincoln furious and wrote Meade a letter. One can find the full letter here. In the letter, Lincoln criticizes Meade’s actions. But Meade never saw that letter since Lincoln never mailed it.     My guess is – and this is only a guess – that after writing that letter, Lincoln looked out of the window and said to himself, “Just a minute. Maybe I ought not to be so hasty. It is easy enough for me to sit here in the quiet of the White House and order Meade to attack; but if I had been up at Gettysburg, and if I had seen as much blood as Meade has seen during the last week, and if my ears had been pierced with the screams and shrieks of the wounded and dying, maybe I wouldn’t be so anxious to attack either. If I had Meade’s timid temperament, perhaps I would have done just what he had done. Anyhow, it is water under the bridge now. If I send this letter, it will relieve my feelings, but it will make Meade try to justify himself. It will make him condemn me. It will arouse hard feelings, impair all his further usefulness as a commander, and perhaps force him to resign from the army.    Changes that we can bring into our life.      Do you know someone you would like to change and regulate and improve? Good! That is fine. I am all in favour of it, but why not begin on yourself? From a purely selfish standpoint, that is a lot more profitable than trying to improve others – yes, and a lot less dangerous. “Don’t complain about the snow on your neighbour’s roof,” said Confucius, “when your own doorstep is unclean.       When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.       Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain – and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.       Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. “To know all is to forgive all.    Give honest and sincere appreciation.   What do we want?      Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great. John Dewey, one of America’s most profound philosophers, phrased it a bit differently. Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is “the desire to be important.       Lincoln once began a letter saying: “Everybody likes a compliment.” William James said: “The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.” He didn’t speak, mind you, of the “wish” or the “desire” or the “longing” to be appreciated. He said the “craving” to be appreciated.    Everybody wants to feel important.   History sparkles with amusing examples of famous people struggling for a feeling of importance.     George Washington wanted to be called “His Mightiness, the President of the United States”; and Columbus pleaded for the title “Admiral of the Ocean and Viceroy of India.” Catherine the Great refused to open letters that were not addressed to “Her Imperial Majesty”; and Mrs. Lincoln, in the White House, turned upon Mrs. Grant like a tigress and shouted, “How dare you be seated in my presence until I invite you!       Our millionaires helped finance Admiral Byrd’s expedition to the Antarctic in 1928 with the understanding that ranges of icy mountains would be named after them; and Victor Hugo aspired to have nothing less than the city of Paris renamed in his honour. Even Shakespeare, mightiest of the mighty, tried to add lustre to his name by procuring a coat of arms for his family.    How people go insane if they don’t find themselves important!      Some authorities declare that people may actually go insane in order to find, in the dreamland of insanity, the feeling of importance that has been denied them in the harsh world of reality. There are more patients suffering from mental diseases in the United States than from all other diseases combined.       If some people are so hungry for a feeling of importance that they actually go insane to get it, imagine what miracle you and I can achieve by giving people honest appreciation this side of insanity.    Why Charles Schwab was paid over a million dollars a year?   Why did Andrew Carnegie pay a million dollars a year, or more than three thousand dollars a day, to Charles Schwab?   One of the first people in American business to be paid a salary of over a million dollars a year (when there was no income tax and a person earning fifty dollars a week was considered well off) was Charles Schwab. He had been picked by Andrew Carnegie to become the first president of the newly formed United States Steel Company in 1921, when Schwab was only thirty-eight years old.   Schwab says that he was paid this salary largely because of his ability to deal with people. Let’s hear it in his own words:     I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,” said Schwab, “the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. “There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.    Make others feel important.      That is what Schwab did. But what do average people do? The exact opposite. If they don’t like a thing, they bawl out their subordinates; if they do like it, they say nothing. As the old couplet says: “Once I did bad and that I heard ever. Twice I did good, but that I heard never.       When a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what do you think was discovered to be the main reason wives ran away? It was “lack of appreciation.” And I’d bet that a similar study made of runaway husbands would come out the same way. We often take our spouses so much for granted that we never let them know we appreciate them.       We nourish the bodies of our children and friends and employees, but how seldom do we nourish their self-esteem? We provide them with roast beef and potatoes to build energy, but we neglect to give them kind words of appreciation that would sing in their memories    Appreciation vs Flattery      The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.       Don’t be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.       Flattery is telling the other person precisely what he thinks about himself.    Changes we can make in our daily life      One of the most neglected virtues of our daily existence is appreciation. Somehow, we neglect to praise our son or daughter when he or she brings home a good report card, and we fail to encourage our children when they first succeed in baking a cake or building a birdhouse. Nothing pleases children more than this kind of parental interest and approval.       In our interpersonal relations we should never forget that all our associates are human beings and hunger for appreciation. It is the legal tender that all souls enjoy.       Let’s try to figure out the other person’s good points. Then forget flattery. Give honest, sincere appreciation. Be “hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise,” and people will cherish your words and treasure them and repeat them over a lifetime – repeat them years after you have forgotten them.    Arouse in the other person an eager want.   Why only talk about what we want!      Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want.       So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.    Examples from real life      One day Ralph Waldo Emerson and his son tried to get a calf into the barn. But they made the common mistake of thinking only of what they wanted: Emerson pushed and his son pulled. But the calf was doing just what they were doing; he was thinking only of what he wanted; so he stiffened his legs and stubbornly refused to leave the pasture. The Irish housemaid saw their predicament. She couldn’t write essays and books; but, on this occasion at least, she had more horse sense, or calf sense, than Emerson had. She thought of what the calf wanted; so she put her maternal finger in the calf’s mouth and let the calf suck her finger as she gently led him into the barn.       Stan came home from work one evening to find his youngest son, Tim, kicking and screaming on the living room floor. He was to start kindergarten the next day and was protesting that he would not go. Stan’s normal reaction would have been to banish the child to his room and tell him he’d just better make up his mind to go. He had no choice. But tonight, recognizing that this would not really help Tim start kindergarten in the best frame of mind, Stan sat down and thought, “If I were Tim, why would I be excited about going to kindergarten?” He and his wife made a list of all the fun things Tim would do such as finger-painting, singing songs, making new friends. Then they put them into action. “We all started finger-painting on the kitchen table – my wife, Lil, my other son Bob, and myself, all having fun. Soon Tim was peeping around the corner. Next he was begging to participate. ‘Oh, no! You have to go to kindergarten first to learn how to finger-paint.’ With all the enthusiasm I could muster I went through the list talking in terms he could understand – telling him all the fun he would have in kindergarten. The next morning, I thought I was the first one up. I went downstairs and found Tim sitting sound asleep in the living room chair. ‘What are you doing here?’ I asked. ‘I’m waiting to go to kindergarten. I don’t want to be late.’ The enthusiasm of our entire family had aroused in Tim an eager want that no amount of discussion or threat could have possibly accomplished.    Think in terms of what other people want.      Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: “How can I make this person want to do it?” That question will stop us from rushing into a situation heedlessly, with futile chatter about our desires.       If there is any one secret of success,” said Henry Ford, “it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.       The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition. Owen D. Young, a noted lawyer and one of America’s great business leaders, once said: “People who can put themselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.       If out of reading this book you get just one thing – an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people’s point of view, and see things from their angle – if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.       Looking at the other person’s point of view and arousing in him an eager want for something is not to be construed as manipulating that person so that he will do something that is only for your benefit and his detriment. Each party should gain from the negotiation.    The little boy had the unholy habit of wetting his bed.   Little Johnny used to sleep with his grandmother. He mad the bed wet every night but he would never accept it. His parents scolded him but that didn’t change his habbit.     What were his wants? First, he wanted to wear pyjamas like Daddy instead of wearing a nightgown like Grandmother. Grandmother was getting fed up with his nocturnal iniquities, so she gladly offered to buy him a pair of pyjamas if he would reform. Second, he wanted a bed of his own. Grandma didn’t object.       His mother took him to a department store in Brooklyn, winked at the salesgirl, and said: “Here is a little gentleman who would like to do some shopping.” The salesgirl made him feel important by saying: “Young man, what can I show you?” He stood a couple of inches taller and said: “I want to buy a bed for myself.” When he was shown the one his mother wanted him to buy, she winked at the salesgirl and the boy was persuaded to buy it.       “You are not going to wet this bed, are you?” the father said. “Oh, no, no! I am not going to wet this bed.”       The boy kept his promise, for his pride was involved. That was his bed. He and he alone had bought it. And he was wearing pyjamas now like a little man. He wanted to act like a man. And he did.    ","categories": ["books"],

        "title": "Paginating results of a django form post request",
        "excerpt":"Several ideas has been shared in this stackoverflow answer as how to paginate results after a post request is made in django. I will be discussing on how to implement some of these ways in this post.   Challenge   In case you wanted to show the results on single page, it would not have been a problem. The challenge lies in the fact that when you are showing your results using several pages, you need to store the post data when returning the second page. Let’s see this with an example.   def index(request):     if(request.method == 'POST'):         form = EmployeeForm(request.POST)         sex = form.cleaned_data['sex']         age = form.cleaned_data['age']         if form.is_valid():             result = Employee.objects.all(sex=sex,age_gte=age) # filter all employees based on sex and age             paginator = Paginator(result, 20) # Show 20 results per page             page = request.GET.get('page')             r = paginator.get_page(page)             render(request, 'app/result.html',{'result':result})     else:         form = EmployeeForm()          return render(request,'app/home.html',.{'form':form})      When the index() is called for the first time, the request will contain the post data and it will return the first 20 results.   Now let’s say you wanted to access the 2nd page(/?page=2) of the result. This time the post data won’t be sent to along with the request, how will you apply filter on query this time? The challenge here is to store the initial post request somewhere.   A solution using cookies   A cookie is basically a small piece of data which is sent by the server and is stores on the client side(web browsers). As we know, http is a stateless protocol. So, cookies were made to maintain a state between client and server. Do keep in mind that cookie is an insecure way of storing information in the sense that anyone having access to your computer can see the contents of the cookie.   In our case, what we can do is to store the post request fields in a cookie. When the post form is submitted, you can send the 20 results and also set the cookie on the client side which contains the post request fields. Let’s see how you can do this with code.   def index(request):     is_cookie_set = 0     # Check if the cookie is already set. If set, get their values and store it.     if 'age' in request.COOKIES and 'sex' in request.COOKIES:          age = request.COOKIES['age']         sex = request.COOKIES['sex']         is_cookie_set = 1     if(request.method == 'POST'):         if(is_cookie_set == 0): # form submission by the user             form = EmployeeForm(request.POST)             sex = form.cleaned_data['sex']             age = form.cleaned_data['age']             if form.is_valid():                 result = Employee.objects.all(sex=sex,age_gte=age) # filter all employees based on sex and age         else: # When the cookie has already been set             result = Employee.objects.all(sex=sex,age_gte=age)         paginator = Paginator(result, 20) # Show 20 results per page         page = request.GET.get('page')         r = paginator.get_page(page)         response = render(request, 'app/result.html',{'result':result})         # When the form is submitted, set the cookie values on client side which can be used to paginate.         if(is_cookie_set == 0):              response.set_cookie('age',age)             response.set_cookie('sex',sex)         return response     else:         form = EmployeeForm()     return render(request,'app/home.html',.{'form':form})   I have included comments to explain the code. This code has not been tested. I am just giving a logic as how to implement it.   A solution using sessions   A major drawback of a cookie is that it is insecure form of storing information as anyone having access to your computer can see it. A session token is a unique identifier that is generated and sent from a server to a client to identify the current interaction session. The client usually stores and sends the token as an HTTP cookie and/or sends it as a parameter in GET or POST queries. Remember only the token is stored on the client side but the actual data(age,sex) is stored on the server side.   The logic and code will be similar to one we implemented for cookie.

        "title": "Inception and the Power of your Subconscious Mind",
        "excerpt":"If you have not seen Inception and hate spoilers, do not read the following.   In the movie titled “Inception” by Christopher Nolan, you would have noticed the frequent use of word “subconscious”. What does the subconscious mean here? In this post, I will be relating the movie with the book “The Power of Subconscious Mind” by Joseph Murphy and explain you what actually subconscious means. I would suggest you to read the book by yourself. It’s one of the finest book ever written.   What is conscious and subconscious mind   Do you remember the opening scene from the movie Inception where Mr. Cobb talks about what an “idea” is with Saito. Below are the exact lines from the movie opening scene.      COBB: What is the most resilient parasite? A bacteria? A virus? An intestinal worm?  ARTHUR: What Mr. Cobb is trying to say…  COBB: An idea. Resilient. Highly contagious. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain, it’s almost impossible to eradicate.  An idea that is fully formed, fully understood, that sticks. Right in there somewhere.  SAITO: For someone like you to steal?  ARTHUR: Yes. In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered… …and that makes your thoughts vulnerable to theft. It’s called extraction.    The idea here are the thoughts that you or others feed into your mind. You think and reason with the help of your conscious mind. Once you have fixed some thoughts into your mind, it’s the duty of subconscious mind to put these thoughts into action. The subconscious mind cannot take decisions like your  conscious mind. The subconscious mind doesn’t question any of your thoughts. It takes the orders from your conscious mind and tries to fulfill it.   The conscious mind is the one with which you think and reason.  The conscious mind is also referred to as objective mind since it deals with outward objects. Your objective mind is in direct contact with the environment with the help of your five senses. It learns through observation, experience and education. The subconscious mind doesn’t have the ability to argue or dispute what it is told. If you give wrong information to your subconscious mind, it will take it and try to make it true for you.   Let me quote some of the lines from the book itself whcih explains the difference between them.      You must remember that the conscious and subconscious are not two minds. They are merely two spheres of activity within one mind. Your conscious mind is the reasoning mind. It is that phase of mind that chooses. For example, you choose your books, your home, and your partner in life. You make all your decisions with your conscious mind. On the other hand, without any conscious choice on your part, your heart is kept functioning automatically, and the vital functions of digestion, circulation, and breathing are carried on by your subconscious mind through processes independent of your conscious control.       Your mind is your most precious possession. It is always with you, but its most amazing powers will be yours only when you have learned how to use it. As we have seen, there are two levels to your mind - the conscious or rational level and the subconscious or irrational level. You think with your conscious mind, and whatever you habitually think sinks down into your subconscious mind, which then creates according to the nature of your thoughts. Your subconscious mind is the seat of your emotions. It is the creative mind. If you think good, good will follow; if you think evil, evil will follow. This is the way your mind works.    How to put subconscious mind to good use   Let’s again take a reference from Inception. In this scene, Mr. Cobb along with Ariadne are on their way to rescue Robert Fisher from Mal.      COBB: An idea is like a virus. Resilient. Highly contagious. And the smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define… …or destroy you.    MAL: The smallest idea, such as: “Your world is not real.” Simple little thought that changes everything.    A thought can either grow to define you or destroy you. Feeding good thoughts to your subconscious mind makes you better and the opposite destroys you. So, we should take care of our thoughts. Once the thoughts are planted into your subconscious mind, it becomes very difficult to remove them. Your subconscious mind starts working to put them into action quickly.   Some quotes from the book related to how to use your subconscious mind.      Imagine your subconscious mind as a bed of rich soil that will help all kinds of seeds to sprout and flourish, whether good or bad. If you sow thorns, will you gather grapes? If you sow thistles, will you harvest figs? Every thought is a cause, and every condition is an effect. This is the reason it is so essential that you take charge of your thoughts. In that way, you can bring forth only desirable conditions.       Begin now to sow thoughts of peace, happiness, right action, goodwill, and prosperity. Think quietly and with conviction on these qualities. Accept them fully in your conscious reasoning mind. Continue to plant these wonderful seeds of thought in the garden of your mind and you will reap a glorious harvest.       Your subconscious mind accepts what is impressed upon it or what you consciously believe. It does not reason things out as your conscious mind does, and it does not argue with you controversially. Your subconscious mind is like a bed of soil that accepts any kind of seed, good or bad. Your thoughts are active; they are the seeds. Negative, destructive thoughts continue to work negatively in your subconscious mind. Sooner or later, they will emerge and take shape as an outer experience that corresponds to their content.    In the above conversation, the seed that was planted into Mal’s subconscious mind was that her world was not real. Once the idea was planted, the subconscious mind made sure that it was true. So, even when Mal returned to the real world, her subconscious mind made her believe that the world was not real and she was still in the dream.   Your subconscious mind is the seat of your emotions   I will use another reference from inception. In this scene, Mr. Cobb along with Saito and others are planning on how to make Robert fisher leave his Father’s empire. There are discussing about the idea that they need to plant into Robert’s mind.      COBB: “I will split up my father’s empire.” Now, this is obviously an idea that Robert himself would choose to reject…which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious.  The subconscious is motivated by emotion, right? Not reason. We need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept.  ARTHUR: How do you translate business strategy into emotion?  COBB: That’s what we’re here to figure out. Robert’s relationship with his father…is stressed, to say the least.  Eames: Can we run with that? We suggest breaking up his father’s company as a “screw you” to the old man.  COBB: No, because I think positive emotion trumps negative emotion every time.We all yearn for reconciliation, for catharsis.We need Robert Fischer to have a positive emotional reaction to all this.    Your subconscious mind is motivated by emotion. It doesn’t argue with your conscious mind. Whatever thought you feed into subconscious mind, your subconscious mind converts it into emotions. If you think good, good will follow. If you think evil, evil will follow. Eames wanted to plant a an idea which was evil. This evil idea would have changed Robert into an evil person.   Some quotes from the book.      If you think negatively, destructively, and viciously, these thoughts generate destructive emotions that must be expressed and must find an outlet. These emotions, being of a negative nature, are frequently expressed as ulcers, heart trouble, tension, and anxieties.       We injure ourselves by the negative ideas we entertain. How often have you wounded yourself by getting angry, fearful, jealous, or vengeful? These are the poisons that enter your subconscious mind. You were not born with these negative attitudes. Feed your subconscious mind life-giving thoughts and you will wipe out all the negative patterns lodged within it. As you continue to do this, all the past will be wiped out and remembered no more.    Your Subconscious mind is more powerful than you think   In the movie, you can see the characters architecting folded cities, a mirrored city, infinite staircases etc. How they were able to design such complex things? There is nothing impossible in this world and if you have the right idea, you can use your subconscious mind to achieve anything.      Your subjective mind sees without the use of the natural organs of vision. It has the capacity of clairvoyance and clairaudience: It can see and hear events that are taking place elsewhere. Your subjective mind can leave your body, travel to distant lands, and bring back information that is often of the most exact and truthful character. Through your subjective mind you can read the thoughts of others, read the contents of sealed envelopes, or intuit the information on a computer disk without using a disk drive.

        "title": "My First Marathon Experience - TCS 10K, Bangalore",
        "excerpt":"In my school and college life, I have participated in a lot of sprint events(100m, 200m and 400m) but never dared to participate in a long running event. The longest running event that I ever participated before was 800m during my college. A huge crowd used to gather to watch the finals of 100 and 200 metres and with the songs like “Chak de India” and “Bhaag Milka Bhaag” running in the background, it was an amazing experience. Still today, I can picture these events in my mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      A journey through my school and college sprint events       These are some of the memories I still carry on with myself. After my 10th class, I wasn’t the same sprinter I used to be since I didn’t practice much owing to my studies. But my base was very strong and that gives me great confidence even today.        “You’re running on guts. On fumes. Your muscles twitch. You throw up. You’re delirious. But you keep running because there’s no way out of this hell you’re in, because there’s no way you’re not crossing the finish line. It’s a misery that non-runners don’t understand.” -Martine Costello    The above line sums up the experience I had with my first marathon today. My stomach was paining and I was getting a sensation of vomiting but I didn’t stop because I wanted to see the finish line. There were many moments when my mind was telling me to take some rest. I did take some rest but I tried to reject my minds suggestion most of the times. Running a marathon is very different from running a sprint. In sprint, it gets all over under 1 minute(400 m). Running a marathon requires motivation, willpower, determination and a lot of practice. While I was running, the only thing that was coming into my mind was to cross the finish line somehow. I did cross the finishing line in 57 minutes and 34 second and that was one of the most satisfying moments of my life. I would love to improve upon the timing when I run a marathon next time. For the event, I have practiced by running on the threadmill. During the marathon, I realised how easy is to run on a threadmill.     I am really thankful to LinkedIn for giving me an opportunity to participate in tcs 10k marathon. I just slept for 3 hours before starting my journey to Sree Kanteerava Stadium which was the starting point for the event. When I arrived, I could see a huge energetic crowd. The atmosphere was very electric with songs playing in the stadium. A crowd of more than 20k plus people had gathered at the stadium to participate in the event. The only other instances when I had seen such a large crowd was during cricket matches.         A huge crowd behind me when I reached the stadium         Selfie before the start of the race   The warm up session started at around 4:50 am and it went on for around 15 minutes. It’s very important to warm up before starting any running event. People then started to gather on tracks and the marathon started at 5:30 am. There were a lot of people in front of you and it was very difficult to find space to overtake someone. After 3 km, my legs became tired and I started to pause in-between. Water and energy drinks were provided by at specific intervals which boosted my energy levels. My stomach also started to pain after 5 km and it was becoming difficult. But I wanted to see the finish line at any cost. During the last 2 km, I felt as if I would vomit. I took rest for sometime and started again.  At last when I saw the banner for last 1 km, I felt very happy and satisfying that I was going to finally complete it. I finally completed the marathon with a timing of 57 minutes and 34 second and I felt very proud of myself.         The moment after I completed the marathon   Everybody was provided with medals(who completed the marathon) and snacks. I sat along with my LinkedIn friends and clicked a lot of photographs. One could see a great satisfaction and proud on everyone’s face.         Customary pose with the medal         LinkedIn friends         My marathon timing and stats   Overall, it was a great event and it has inspired me to practice more and also participate in such events in the future.

        "title": "Important life lessons learnt from The Alchemist",
        "excerpt":"   It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting    The Alchemist is a very popular novel written by Paulo Coelho which was first published in 1988. The book is about the journey of a small boy named Santiago in finding his dream. One morning, Santiago dreams of a treasure hidden inside the Pyramids of Egypt. In his journey to the Pyramids of Egypt, he meets a lot of people and each of them teaches him some important lessons about life. We look at some of the important lessons the boy learns in his journey.   Follow your dreams   At the core, the book is all about following your dreams. It’s having a dream come true that makes life interesting. When a dream gets fulfilled, it’s not only the result that matters. What matters most in pursuing a dream is the journey itself. The journey to our destiny teaches us a lot of important things about life and people. The job is almost half done when one makes a decision in his mind to follow the dream. When you start the journey, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.   An Alchemist is the one who can change ordinary metals into gold. There are three types of people we see in our day to day life.     One who works hard and learns the process of how to convert ordinary metals into gold through practice.   One who stumbled upon the gold by accident. They are very gifted and are rare.   The others who are only interested in gold but don’t want to work.   The above context can be applied to dreams too. Some just keeps on dreaming, some work very hard towards achieving it and some rare and talented people achieve it by accident.   The principle of favourability or beginner’s luck   One of the important people the boy meets in his journey is a king who teaches him about beginner’s luck. You would have noticed that when you play a game like cards for the first time, you are almost sure to win. This is called the beginner’s luck. A beginner has not much to loose and doesn’t have much expectations unlike the others who are playing the game for long. At the beginning of the journey towards your dream, the luck will favour you and everything will go as planned. It’s in the middle and end of the journey you will be tested the most and most of us give up at this point in the journey.      Before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we’ve learned as we’ve moved toward that dream. That’s the point at which most people give up. It’s the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one ‘dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.    Learn to live in the present and become better   If you live in the present, you will be a happy man. If one keeps on making himself better and better by each passing day, the future will also be brighter for him. We should also not live in the past but we should carry the learnings from the past to the present. In the book, the child learns from the past and improves upon it.      When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too When each day is the same as the next, it’s because people fail to recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises    Love is a language everybody stands   There is only one common language in the world and it’s the language of love. You can use this language to talk to every creature in the universe whether it’s humans or animals. In the book, the boy is in search of the language that everybody stands. The boy was able to talk to his sheep, the camel, the wind, the sun and the candy maker even through they didn’t understand his language. It’s only when he meets Fatima in the dessert that he realises the the language that everybody stands.      When he looked into her eyes, he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke – the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert. What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. Because when you know the language, it’s easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it’s in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each other, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such love, one’s dreams would have no meaning.       When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.    Always listen to your heart   In the journey to make the dream come true, one has to follow his heart. Our heart is a place of emotions. The emotions will keep changing during your journey. Sometimes, you will be frightened with the idea that you will fail in this journey. And sometimes, you will be happy when everything is going good. It’s natural to have a fear inside our self since we may lose everything while pursuing our dream or we may fail in the journey itself. Since you also have dreams and wishes in your heart, the heart will be able to deal with your fear and other negative emotions.      Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s encounter with God and with eternity. Don’t give in to your fears. If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart. Remember that wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure    Focus on your own journey      If someone isn’t what others want them to be, the others become angry. Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.    ","categories": ["books"],

        "title": "Instances when Virender Sehwag hit his first ball for a boundary",
        "excerpt":"     Virender Sehwag was a fearless batsman. He would start attacking the opposition right from ball one. This was the one thing that made Sehwag unique. If there was a ball to be hit, he would hit it. There was a time when he started his innings with a four in 6 consecutive matches. It also meant that India’s scorecard read 4-0 after 0.1 overs. It included 5 instances during the 2011 world cup that India won. Sehwag had also his first ball for a six once in ODI. It was during the 2nd final of VB Series in 2004 and India was chasing a huge total of 359. India went on to lose the match but his first ball six still remains in our memory.   Sehwag first ball six against Ausalia in 2004      List of matches where Sehwag started his innings with a four/six:   International Matches   | #  | Date     | Venue                                        | Format | Opposition   | Bowler            | Runs | |—-|———-|———————————————-|——–|————–|——————-|——| | 1  | 28/03/06 | Feroz Shah Kotla                             | ODI    | England      | JM Anderson       | 4    | | 2  | 12/04/06 | Keenan Stadium                               | ODI    | England      | JM Anderson       | 4    | | 3  | 03/12/06 | SuperSport Park                              | ODI    | South Africa | SM Pollock        | 4    | | 4  | 14/09/07 | Kingsmead                                    | T20    | Pakistan     | Umar Gul          | 4    | | 5  | 31/07/08 | Galle International Stadium                  | Test   | Sri Lanka    | KMDN Kulasekara   | 4    | | 6  | 08/08/08 | P Saravanamuttu Stadium                      | Test   | Sri Lanka    | KTGD Prasad       | 4    | | 7  | 23/11/08 | M Chinnaswamy Stadium                        | ODI    | England      | JM Anderson       | 4    | | 8  | 18/03/09 | Seddon Park                                  | Test   | New Zealand  | KD Mills          | 4    | | 9  | 25/02/09 | AMI Stadium                                  | T20    | New Zealand  | TG Southee        | 6    | | 10 | 26/03/09 | McLean Park                                  | Test   | New Zealand  | IE O’Brien        | 4    | | 11 | 25/10/09 | Reliance Stadium                             | ODI    | Australia    | B Lee             | 4    | | 12 | 02/11/09 | Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Mohali   | ODI    | Australia    | MG Johnson        | 4    | | 13 | 16/11/09 | Sardar Patel Stadium, Motera                 | Test   | Sri Lanka    | UWMBCA Welegedara | 4    | | 14 | 16/11/09 | Sardar Patel Stadium, Motera                 | Test   | Sri Lanka    | UWMBCA Welegedara | 4    | | 15 | 09/12/09 | Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium, Jamtha | T20    | Sri Lanka    | KMDN Kulasekara   | 4    | | 16 | 18/12/09 | Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium, Jamtha | ODI    | Sri Lanka    | UWMBCA Welegedara | 4    | | 17 | 24/12/09 | Eden Gardens                                 | ODI    | Sri Lanka    | NLTC Perera       | 4    | | 18 | 19/02/11 | Shere Bangla National Stadium                | ODI    | Bangladesh   | Shafiul Islam     | 4    | | 19 | 27/02/11 | M Chinnaswamy Stadium                        | ODI    | England      | JM Anderson       | 4    | | 20 | 06/03/11 | M Chinnaswamy Stadium                        | ODI    | Ireland      | WB Rankin         | 4    | | 21 | 09/03/11 | Feroz Shah Kotla                             | ODI    | Netherlands  | Mudassar Bukhari  | 4    | | 22 | 12/03/11 | Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium, Jamtha | ODI    | South Africa | DW Steyn          | 4    | | 23 | 10/08/10 | Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium       | ODI    | New Zealand  | DR Tuffey         | 4    | | 24 | 28/08/10 | Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium       | ODI    | Sri Lanka    | SL Malinga        | 4    | | 25 | 02/01/11 | Newlands                                     | Test   | South Africa | M Morkel          | 4    | | 26 | 09/10/10 | M Chinnaswamy Stadium                        | Test   | Australia    | MG Johnson        | 4    | | 27 | 24/01/12 | Adelaide Oval                                | Test   | Australia    | BW Hilfenhaus     | 4    | | 28 | 06/11/11 | Feroz Shah Kotla                             | Test   | West Indies  | FH Edwards        | 4    | | 29 | 29/11/11 | Barabati Stadium                             | ODI    | West Indies  | KAJ Roach         | 4    | | 30 | 31/08/12 | M Chinnaswamy Stadium                        | Test   | New Zealand  | TG Southee        | 4    |     IPL Matches                  #

        "title": "Predicting probability of winning of chasing team in cricket using machine learning algorithms",
        "excerpt":"   You would have seen Winning and Score Predictor(WASP) tool being used in matches that happens in New Zealand. This predicts the final score of team batting first and probability of winning for the team batting second.     WASP uses data from past matches to arrive at a particular model for prediction. We will also be using data from the past matches to create the prediction model. In ODI and T-20 cricket, many factors play a key role in deciding whether the chasing team will win or lose.  Let’s look at some of the key factors:      Target for the chasing team   Number of wickets left   Number of balls left   On how much scores are the current batsman batting?   How much the team had scored in last 5 overs?   How much the team had lost wickets in last 5 overs?   The nature of the pitch   How strong is the batting and bowling team?   I will use some of these factors to predict probability of winning of chasing team using machine learning algorithms. We use logistic regression algorithm in machine learning to predict predict probability of winning of chasing team in ODI or T-20 match.   Preparing the dataset   I have not scrapped the web pages to prepare the dataset. I have downloaded the dataset from cricsheet. The site gives us ball by ball details of matches. I then wrote a custom code to only include some of the features which I will be using.   The dataset contains ball by ball coverage of:      ODI matches: data/odi.csv   T-20 matches: data/t20.csv   IPL matches: data/ipl.csv   Each dataset consists of following columns(features):      mid: Each match is given a unique number   date: When the match happened   venue: Stadium where match is being played   bat_team: Batting team name   bowl_team: Bowling team name   batsman: Batsman name who faced that ball   bowler: Bowler who bowled that ball   runs: Total runs scored by team at that instance   wickets: Total wickets fallen at that instance   overs: Total overs bowled at that instance   runs_last_5: Total runs scored in last 5 overs   wickets_last_5: Total wickets that fell in last 5 overs   striker: max(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)   non-striker: min(runs scored by striker, runs scored by non-striker)   total: Total runs scored by batting team after first innings         Importing the dataset       import pandas as pd # Importing the dataset dataset = pd.read_csv('data/%.csv'%(match_type)) X = dataset.iloc[:,[7,8,9,12,13,14]].values #input features y = dataset.iloc[:, 15].values #label/output   I have used ‘odi.csv’ datafile here for predicting probability. One can use ‘t20.csv’ or ‘ipl.csv’ if they want to predict probability for T-20 matches or IPL matches respectively.   Features Used:      runs   wickets   overs   striker   non-striker   target   Why didn’t I use other features?   While experimenting, all the other features didn’t make much difference in results. You can use a different combination of features and test the code on them.   Label Used: Win/loss(win-1,loss-0)   Splitting data into training and testing set   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 0)   We will train our model on 75 percent of the dataset and test the model on remaining dataset.   Feature Scaling the data   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler sc = StandardScaler() X_train = sc.fit_transform(X_train) X_test = sc.transform(X_test)   Feature scaling is a very important part of machine learning. You can read more about it here      Training the datase   from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression lin = LogisticRegression(random_state=0, solver='lbfgs',multi_class='multinomial') lin.fit(X_train,y_train)   Testing the dataset on trained model   y_pred = lin.predict(X_test) score = lin.score(X_test,y_test)*100 print(\"R Square Value: \" , score)  R-squared value: R-sqaured is a statistic that will give some information about the goodness of fit of a model.

        "title": "18 times when Dhoni finished a cricket match with a six",
        "excerpt":"   “Dhoni finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd! India lift the World Cup after 28 years!”       If you love Dhoni or hate Dhoni, you will always cherish the above moment - Dhoni finishing the 2011 WC final with a six. Dhoni has finished a lot of matches with a six before this one but this one was special. When I watch this moment again and again today, I get goosbumps all over my body.   When Dhoni arrived at the International stage, he used to be very agressive. His agressive batting won India a lot of matches against Pakistan and Sri Lanka during his initial stages. As the time passed by and he got additional responsibility of captaincy, his batting approach chnaged. He started taking calculated risks and tried to take the match till last overs. Sometimes the approach worked and sometimes it didn’t. But we saw very less of finishing sixes. We still do see the “Dhoni of past” in IPL.

        "title": "Cricketscreener - A Tool to Anaylze ball by ball Cricket Data",
        "excerpt":"I have been playing with cricket data a lot and thought of sharing with everyone a tool I developed to analyse ball by ball data from more than 4000+ matches. I have named this tool as CRICKETSCREENER and just released the first version of it. This tool can be helpful to anyone who wishes to play with ball by ball cricket data.   NOTE: cricketscreener.com works best on desktop browsers   Video demo on how to use cricketscreener.com    Cricket Data Source  The data used for this tool has been taken from cricsheet. I would be very thankful to the cricsheet team to make this data available online.   About cricsheet:     Cricsheet is Retrosheet for Cricket. We provide ball-by-ball data for Men’s and Women’s Test Matches, One-day internationals, Twenty20 Internationals, some other international T20s, and all Indian Premier League seasons.       At the moment we have ball-by-ball information for 4,418 matches, comprising 415 Test matches, 6 other multi-day matches, 1,594 One-day internationals, 199 other one-day matches, 821 T20 internationals, 157 international T20s, 756 Indian Premier League matches, 292 Big Bash League matches, 121 NatWest T20 Blast matches, and 57 Pakistan Super League matches featuring 62 countries, 47 club teams, and 2 representative XIs going back as far as 2009 (for women), and 2005 (for men).    Missing matches: missing matches   Using the data  Cricsheet provides ball by ball data in many formats such as yaml, csv and xml. As I was alreday good with playing with xml data in python, I chose to use the xml data files.   Data download: downloads   I wrote a python script to extract the data from xml files and insert it into a database. My long term goal would be to open-source these scripts.   Database Schema:      At the present moment, I have just a single table and it is not optimised for speed and space. Each row in this table is a ball data from a particular match. Most of the columns in the table should be self-explanatory. Let me exaplain all attributes.   Match attributes      mid - Each match has a unique match id.   gender - This will be either male or female.   Date - The day on which the match started.   team1 - One of the team that is involved in the match.   team2 - other team that is involved in the match.   venue - Where is the match being played?   match_type - Which format of cricket - odi, test or t-20?   comp - This is only specific for t-20 matches(IPL,PSL,BBL)   winner - Winner of the match if any.   mom - man of the match.   inning attributes      inning - which inning of the match?   bat_team - which team is batting?   bow_team - which team is bowling?   is_las_ball - Is this the last ball of the inning?   Per ball attributes      overs - the over number.   balls - the ball number of a particular over.   batsman - batsman who is facing the ball   non-striker - batsman who is not on strike   bowler - bowler bowling the ball   bruns - how many runs the batsman scored on that ball?   eruns - how many extra runs were conceeded if any?   e_type - type of extras(wide,no ball etc) if any   iswicket - Did wicket fall on the ball - 0/1?   w_type - how the player was dismissed(bowled,caught etc)?   fielder - which fielder was involved in dismissal?   player_out - which player got out?   A sample row from the table.    Once the data is stored in the table, I have created a form in django(python web framework) which takes input from the user and then queries this table.   What queries one can make   At present, the aggregation is only based on runs, wickets, fours and sixes. My long term goal would be to include more features.      Find out how many runs a batsman has scored against a particular bowler - Dhoni vs Steyn or Kohli vs Malinga?   Find out how a bowler has  faired against a batsman - Kohli vs Anderson or Zaheer vs Smith?   Find out batsman who have hit six on their first ball faced in the match - Sehwag?   These are some of the examples. I will show how to perform these queries in a video tutorial.   What queries one cannot make      Finding out the highest run scorers in test or odi   Finding out how many centuries, fifties, fifers etc. a player has taken   In simple words, you won’t be able to use the tool to analyse stats that is based on aggregating data. You can use espncricinfo stats for these queries.   Future   I would love everyone to use the tool and suggest new features that can be added to this or report any bugs.      Query support for t-20 leagues like IPL and BBL.   Query support for women’s matches.   Include aggregated fours, sixes, extras etc. in the result   Make the tool fast by optimizing the database and using cache.   Do suggest other ideas in the comment.   ","categories": ["python"],

        "title": "Understanding process creation in operating system with fork, exec and wait system calls",
        "excerpt":"   A process begins its life when it is created. A process goes through different states before it gets terminated. The first state that any process goes through is the creation of itself. Process creation happens through the use of fork() system call, which creates a new process(child process) by duplicating an existing one(parent process). The process that calls fork() is the parent, whereas the new process is the child.   In most cases, we may want to execute a different program in child process than the parent. The exec() family of function calls creates a new address space and loads a new program into it.   Finally, a process exits or terminates using the exit() system call. This function frees all the resources held by the process(except for pcb). A parent process can enquire about the status of a terminated child using wait() system call. When the parent process uses wait() system call, the parent process is blocked till the child on which it is waiting terminates.      If you find reading boring, you can watch process creation videos to understand the below concepts.   Fork() System Call   When a parent process uses fork(), it creates a duplicate copy of itself and this duplicates becomes the child of the process. The fork() is implemented using clone() system call in linux which returns twice from kernel.      A non-zero value(Process ID of child) is returned to the parent.   A value of zero is returned to the child.   In case the child is not created successfully due to any issues like low memory, -1 is returned to the fork().   Let’s understand this with some code   pid = fork();  // Both child and parent will now start execution from here. if(pid &lt; 0) {     //child was not created successfully     return 1; } else if(pid == 0) {     // This is the child process     // Child process code goes here } else {     // Parent process code goes here } printf(\"This is code common to parent and child\");        How Parent and Child Process differs?   A parent and child differs in some of the PCB(process control block) attributes. These are:      PID - Both child and parent have a different Process ID.   Pending Signals - The child doesn’t inherit Parent’s pending signals. It will be empty for the child process when created.   Memory Locks - The child doesn’t inherit its parent’s memory locks. Memory locks are locks which can be used to lock a memory area and then this memory area cannot be swapped to disk.   Record Locks - The child doesn’t inherit its parent’s record locks. Record locks are associated with a file block or an entire file.   Process resource utilisation and CPU time consumed is set to zero for the child.   The child also doesn’t inherit timers from the parent.   If you want to understand the above differences in detail - (fork manual)[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html#DESCRIPTION]   Is Address Space(memory) duplicated for child?   The answers in no. After the fork(), both parent and child share the memory address space of the parent. In linux, these address space are divided into multiple pages. Only when the child writes to one of the parent memory pages, a duplicate of that page is created for the child. This is also known as copy on write(Copy parent pages only when the child writes to it).   Understanding copy-on-write with code:   int x = 2; pid = fork(); if(pid == 0) {     x = 10;     // child is changing the value of x or writing to a page     // One of the parent stack page will contain this local variable. That page will be duplicated for child and it will store the value 10 in x in duplicated page.   } else {     x = 4; }   In case you want to understand about fork system call in details, watch the below video:    Exec System Call   The exec family of functions replaces the current running program(executable) with a new executable. This is very useful when you want the child process to run a different program than the parent. Take example of the shell program. A shell takes commands as input from the user, runs it and displays the output on screen. Each command corresponds to a new program. The number of shell commands in any operating system is huge. It would be very bad code design to append the program or executable associated with all the available commands in a single program. In this case, the shell(parent process) can create a child process when a user types a command and let the child process execute the command.   /* fork a child process */ pid = fork(); if (pid &lt; 0) {     /* error occurred */     return 1; } else if (pid == 0) {     /* child process */     execlp(\"/bin/ls\", \"ls\", NULL); // A new program(ls executable is loaded into memory and executed } else {     /* parent process */     /* parent will wait for the child to complete */     wait(NULL);     printf(\"Child Complete\"); } return 0;        Why is exec() system call necessary?   It’s not necessary to use exec() with fork(). If the code that the child will execute is within the program associated with parent, exec() is not needed.   But think of cases when the child has to run multiple programs. Let’s take the example of shell program. It supports multiple commands like find, mv, cp, date etc. Will be it right to include program code associated with these commands in one program or have child load these programs into the memory when required?   It all depends on your use case. You have a web server which given an input x that returns the 2^x to the clients. For each request, the web server creates a new child and asks it to compute. Will you write a separate program to calculate this and use exec()? Or you will just write computation code inside the parent program?   Wait System Call   A process may wait on another process to complete its execution. The parent process may issue a wait system call, which suspends the execution of the parent process while the child executes. When the child process terminates, it returns an exit status to the operating system, which is then returned to the waiting parent process. The parent process then resumes execution.   When the child terminates, the kernel notifies this to the waiting parent using signal(SIGCHLD) and allowing it to retrieve the child process’s exit status.   In the above code example used for exec() system call, the shell(parent process) was waiting for its child to complete. Once the child terminates, it can return the output and exit code of the command to the user.      Why does parent waits for a child process?      The parent can assign a task to it’s child and wait till it completes it’s task. Then it can carry some other work.   Once the child terminates, all the resources associated with child are freed except for the process control block. Now, the child is in zombie state. Using wait(), parent can inquire about the status of child and then ask the kernel to free the PCB. In case parent doesn’t uses wait, the child will remain in the zombie state.   The second reason is very important. I will discuss about zombie process in a separate post but you can understand it by watching the below video.    Exit System Call   A computer process terminates its execution by making an exit system call. When the child process terminates (“dies”), either normally by calling exit, or abnormally due to a fatal exception or signal (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGKILL), an exit status is returned to the operating system and a SIGCHLD signal is sent to the parent process. The exit status can then be retrieved by the parent process via the wait system call.   Exit system call is not always implicit in a program. A process can also terminate/return if control reaches the end of the function.     Why is copy-on-write needed?   Since we have covered the process creation in details, we can now understand why copy-on-write is needed.   A typical process creation takes place through fork()-exec() combination. Let’s first understand what exec() does.   Exec() group of functions replaces the child’s address space with a new program. Once exec() is called within a child, a separate address space will be created for the child which is totally different from the parent’s one.   If there was no copy on write mechanism associated with fork(), duplicate pages would have created for the child and all the data would have been copied to child’s pages. Allocating new memory and copying data is a very expensive process(takes processor’s time and other system resources). We also know that in most cases, the child is going to call exec() and that would replace the child’s memory with a new program. So the first copy which we did would have been a waste if copy on write was not there.          ","categories": ["operating system"],

The producer and consumer share a fixed-size buffer used as a queue. The producer’s job is to generate data and put this in the buffer. The consumer’s job is to consume the data from this buffer, one at a time.   Problem Statement   How do you make sure that producer doesn’t try to put data in buffer when the buffer is full and consumer doesn’t try to consumer data when the buffer is empty?   When producer tries to put data into the buffer when it is full, it wastes cpu cycles. The same is true for consumer it tries to consumer from an empty buffer. It’s better that they go on sleep in these cases so that the scheduler can schedule another process.       Pseudocode Solution using Semaphore and Mutex   Initialization   Mutex mutex; // Used to provide mutual exclusion for critical section Semaphore empty = N; // Number of empty slots in buffer Semaphore full = 0 // Number of slots filled int in = 0; //index at which producer will put the next data int out = 0; // index from which the consumer will consume next data int buffer[N];       Producer Code   while(True) {    // produce an item    wait(empty); // wait/sleep when there are no empty slots    wait(mutex);    buffer[in] = item    in = (in+1)%buffersize;    signal(mutex);    signal(full); // Signal/wake to consumer that buffer has some   data and they can consume now }   Consumer Code   while(True) {    wait(full); // wait/sleep when there are no full slots    wait(mutex);    item = buffer[out];    out = (out+1)%buffersize;    signal(mutex);    signal(empty); // Signal/wake the producer that buffer slots are emptied and they can produce more    //consumer the item }   Solution in C using Semaphore and Mutex   We will be converting the above Pseudocode to actual code in C language. Let’s first have a look at some important data structures we will be using in the code.      One can use include  header file and declare a semaphore of type sem_t in c.

Suppose that a database is to be shared among several concurrent processes. Some of these processes may want only to read the database, whereas others may want to update (that is, to read and write) the database. We distinguish between these two types of processes by referring to the former as readers and to the latter as writers. Obviously, if two readers access the shared data simultaneously, no adverse effects will result. However, if a writer and some other process (either a reader or a writer) access the database simultaneously, chaos may ensue.   To ensure that these difficulties do not arise, we require that the writers have exclusive access to the shared database while writing to the database. This synchronization problem is referred to as the readers-writers problem.   The readers-writers problem has several variations, all involving priorities. The simplest one, referred to as the first readers-writers problem, requires that no reader be kept waiting unless a writer has already obtained permission to use the shared object. In other words, no reader should wait for other readers to finish simply because a writer is waiting.       Pseudocode Solution using Semaphore and Mutex   Initialization   Semaphore wrt = 1; // A binary semaphore that will be used both for mutual exclusion and signalling Mutex mutex; // Provides mutual exclusion when readcount is being modified int readcount = 0; // To keep count of the total readers   Writer   wait(wrt); // Perform write operation signal(wrt);       READER   wait(mutex); readcount++; if(readcount == 1) {     wait(wrt); } signal(mutex); // Perform read operation  wait(mutex); readcount--; if(readcount == 0) {     signal(wrt); } signal(mutex);      Writer can only write when the readcount is zero or there are no readers waiting.   If the first reader executes wait(wrt) operation before the writer does, then writer gets blocked.   Only when the last reader exits, it calls the signal(wrt) operation signalling writer to continue   Similarly, when a writer starts writing(readcount=0) then the first reader gets blocked on wait(wrt) and this blocks all the readers.

        "title": "Interrupts In Operating System",
        "excerpt":"   What is an interrupt   A core responsibility of any operating system kernel is managing the hardware connected to the machine — hard drives and Blu-ray discs, keyboards and mice, 3D processors and wireless radios. To meet this responsibility, the kernel needs to communicate with the machine’s individual devices.   But there is an issue here:     Hardware devices are typically slower than the processor.   Not ideal to issue a request to a hardware device and then wait.   Better to be free and handle some productive work rather than waiting.   Ways to overcome the above issue     Polling - The kernel can check the status of the hardware periodically. There is an overhead here of checking regularly whether the hardware device is busy or not. What if the hardware device has the ability to signal to the kernel when attention is needed?   Interrupt    An interrupt is an input signal to the processor indicating an event needs immediate attention. Interrupts can either be generated in response    to hardware or software events.   By interrupts, we normally refer to the hardware interrupts.      Types of interrupts   Hardware or asynchronous interrupts     These interrupts are generated by a hardware device like keyboard, mouse, disks etc when attention is required.   These interrupts can arrive at any time even when the processor is in the middle of executing an instruction. Therefore, hardware interrupts are also  called as asynchronous interrupts.   Example: When you type on the keyboard, a signal is sent to the CPU. The cpu then interrupts the running process and gives attention to this signal.   Software or synchronous interrupt     A software interrupt is issued by the processor itself or by some instruction that is running on the processor.   Since these interrupts are caused by instructions running on the processor, these are also called as synchronous interrupt.   Example: Divide by zero error in programs.       Types of software interrupts   Traps     Traps are intentionally generated by the program. A special instruction named int is executed which helps in switching from user mode to kernel mode.   These are called traps since it helps in trapping into the kernel space.   System calls are called from a program using trap since system call requires switch from user to kernel mode.   Faults     The program causes a recoverable error or an execption.   Example: Segmentation fault, page fault, divide by zero error etc.   Aborts     The program causes a non-recoverable error or an execption.   The program in this case is aborted since these types of errors cannot be caught.   Example: Hardware errors like corruption of disk.   Faults and aborts are a type of exceptions. Software interrupts are also sometimes called as exceptions.   In the next blog, we will see how interrupt handling happens.       ","categories": [],

        "title": "What is an operating system and it's functions",
        "excerpt":"   Definition   We don’t have a universal definition for defining an opertaing system. Some of the ways books define an operating system are as as follows:      An operating system is a system program that manages the system’s hardware.   An operating system acts as an interface between the user and the hardware.   If you notice, hardware is mentioned in both the definitions. Let’s try to combine these two definitions into one.   An operating system is a program that acts as an interface betwwen the user and the hardware.   We will later discuss in details what do we exactly mean by this definition.     Components of an operating system   An operating system includes all the programs that are associated with the operatin of the system.      Kernel - It is the heart of the operating system   Device Drivers - It is used to communicate with the devices   User interface - UI/CLI   System libraries like glibc   System utilities like disk formatters, antivirus, data recovery tools etc.   It is not always easy to differenciate between application programs and system programs. Microsoft in 1998 argues that Internet Explorer was as system software that cannot be uninstalled.          What is a kernel in operating system   A kernel is the heart of the operating system. Kernel is nothing but a computer program that is always resident in main memory and running. If the kernel stops, the operating system dies. The kernel code is a major part of operating system’s code.   Which code helps in interaction between the user/application and the hardware devices? It’s the kernel code.   When you look at the different functions of the kernel, you will understand how important a kernel is.   Functions of kernel      Process management            Managing lifecyle of a process from creating a process to terminating it       Scheduling process - Among multiple processes in system, which process will get which CPU and for how much time?       Helps in coordination between multiple processes when they want to share data           Memory management            Keeping track of which parts of main meory are being used and which are free       Deciding which process/pages move out of main meory when it is full       Allocating required memory for processes           File management            Creating and deleting files and folders       Storage of files on the disk       Manipulation of files like renaming, copying, permissions etc.           Device management - With the help of interrupts and device drivers, the kernel communicates with the devices like keyboard, mouse, disk etc.   Protection and security - Allowing the acccess to processes and files only to the users who are allowded. Th kernel which runs in priviledged mode also helps in preventing attacks from  viruses.   When does an operating system becomes a kernel?   In embedded devices, you don’t require a user interface and system utilities. In these devices, an operating system code is just the kernel code.   Functions of an operating System        Since kernel is part of the operating system, all the functions of the kernel like process management, memory management, file management etc are also functions of an operating system.   Included GUI/CLI for intercation with the system   Includes sytem libraries and utilities          Architecture diagram of an operating system      One can see in the above diagram how operating system is acting as an interface between uses/applications and system hardware with the help of the kernel. Let’s understand what happens when a application wants to write to a file.      A programmer uses the fwrite() function in C to write to a file. This fwrite() function is a part of glibc library and its function prototypes are defined under “stdio.h” header file.   fwrite() is an API used for writing to file. When the fwrite() function is called, it makes a call to the function that is defined in the library.   The fwrite() library function then invokes a system call write(). If a user program wants to interact with the kernel, it is done through system calls.   Once the system call is made, the system call function definition is invoked. This function definition is under kernel code.   The kernel then uses device drivers to talk to the device where the file is present. It then asks the device driver to write the contents into the file.   If you want to understand more about system calls, do watch the below video. System calls are very important to kernel.

        "title": "What is a site reliability engineer and how they differ from sysadmin",
        "excerpt":"      “Software engineering has this in common with having children: the labor before the birth is painful and difficult, but the labor after the birth is where you actually spend most of your effort. Yet software engineering as a discipline spends much more time talking about the first period as opposed to the second, despite estimates that 40–90% of the total costs of a system are incurred after birth.” - Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems       It is wrong to assume that code once deployed doesn’t need much attention from the software engineers. If the services break down in production, it can cause huge loss to the company.   Software engineers focus on designing and building softwares.   But who will focus on keeping the service up most of the time? What happens when the service breaks down in production due to some code changes? Software engineers?   The knowledge required for building softwares and operating it are different. Even if software engineers have the knowledge, the burden on them will increase. Who then should be responsible for keeping the service up most of the time? Let’s first look at the traditional approach of deploying services and operating them.           Sysadmin Approach to Service management   Historically, companies have employed system administrators or sysadmin to run their systems and some companies do follow this practice even today.  Let’s now look at the advantages and disadvantages of the approach shown in the above diagram.   Advantage     Easy to implement   Talent pool of sysadmins widely available   Tools to integrate are also easily available   Disadvantage           Direct costs              A manual intervention is required for change management or deploying code and also handling the events that happen after deployment.       This manual process becomes expensive as the traffic to the service increases. More traffic leads to more features being pushed out by developers regularly and additional load on the system which can lead to poor performance of the service.       The size of the operation teams need to be scaled with the additional load and increase in change management velocity.                Indirect costs              The two teams, development and operation team are quite different in background, skill set and incentives.       Developers are from computer science background vs operators from networking background       The development teams want to launch new features regularly and push it to the customers. If developers don’t complete the jira tickets assigned to them, they may get fired.       The operations team wants to make sure that the service doesn’t break. If the operations team fails to keep the site up regularly, they may get fired.       Since most outages are caused by some kind of change, the operations team resists making new changes to the stable system. Thus, both the teams end up in conflict.           What if we can follow a different approach to run the systems? What if we can come up with software solutions to the above problem?          What is a Site Reliability Engineer or a SRE      SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team - Ben Treynor, founder of Google’s Site Reliability Team       SREs are engineers who have sound knowledge of the principles of computer science.            Write code along with our development counterparts       Write code for automating certain manual stuff - monitoring, deploying, failout etc.       Figuring out how to apply existing solutions to new problems - caching       Review the design of new products and features along with the development team - is the product resilient to failures?           SREs focus on system reliability            When services like facebook, google or linkedin goes down, who gets pinged first? The SRE oncall of the team that handles it.       If a service is not reliable, nobody is going to use the service.       A service that consistently performs as it is expected to do is considered a reliable service.       If some service is not reliable, it may lead to users moving to similar services provided by the competitors.           SREs operate services built on top of distributed systems like storage, tools, networks etc.         Responsibilities of a Site Reliability Engineer     In general, an SRE team is responsible for the availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of their service(s).   Engineering Work   A SRE should spend at least 50% of their time in engineering work.     Writing code for the services they own along with the developers   Writing tools to automate manual work   Writing documentation for the work they have done   Working along with the development team to discuss ongoing issues and how the issues can be tackled   Helping developers push changes frequently without voilating a service’s SLO      Developers main goal is to push their code changes as quickly as they can to customers.   SREs main goal is to keep the service stable in production.   As 70% of the outrages are caused by a change in code or configuration, goals of the developers and SREs conflict.   This conflict can be resolved with the help of error budgets.   SREs and developers sit together to decide Service Level Objectives(SLO) for their services. We will discuss SLO in detail in future blogs.   One of the SLOs can be to maintain 99.9% availability for the service. A service that’s 99.99% available is 0.01% unavailable. That permitted 0.01% unavailability is the service’s error budget.   Development team can use this error budget to push changes fast to the customers.   SRE’s goal is no longer “zero outages”; rather, SREs and product developers aim to spend the error budget getting maximum feature velocity.   Monitoring   Monitoring is one of the primary means by which service owners keep track of a system’s health and availability.     Responsible for setting up alerts on their services.            Alert if the percentage of errors start increasing on their services       Alert if the latency start increasing on their services           Tweaking the thresholds of these alerts from time to time depending on various changes happening around the service   Emergency Response   A SRE is also responsible for handling the oncall for their team. In most teams, oncall lasts for a week. The frequency of oncall depends on the size of the team. On an average, one should be spending around a week on oncall each month. When you are oncall, you are responsible for the following:     Handle all the alerts for the services your team owns, debug why alerts have fired, restore normal service and conduct post mortem if necessary.   Oncall work is a very operation heavy task.   As an oncall, you act as a shield to your teammates(SRE). If there are any ad hoc tasks, you are responsible to pick it up and not disturb other SREs who are focussing on engineering work.        Change Management   SRE has found that roughly 70% of outages are due to changes in a live system. As a SRE, you are responsible for:     Implementing progressive rollouts - testing -&gt; canary -&gt; production   Quickly and accurately detecting problems with the help of monitoring   Rolling back changes safely when problems arise.   The above practices help in minimizing the number of users or services impacted by the bad change in the code.   Capacity Planning   Capacity planning is the process of determining the production capacity or number of servers needed to meet changing demands for the products. What happens if the development team ramps a viral product feature  and the service is not able to handle the increased demand? In worst cases, your service may become unavailable if you do not do capacity planning for your service. In other cases, you may see increase in latency/errors for your service. These all will bring the availability down for your service.   Capacity planning should take both organic growth (which stems from natural product adoption and usage by customers) and inorganic growth (which results from events like feature launches, marketing campaigns, or other business-driven changes) into account. Regular load testing should be done to find out the maximum qps that your services can handle before breaking down.   Efficiency and Performance   Efficient use of resources is important any time a service cares about money. What happens when your service latency crosses the target latency that was set up? Do you directly increase the number of servers? For handling the issue in the short term, it would be a good thing to do. In addition to capacity planning and provisioning the required capacity, a SRE should also work with the developers to improve the performance of the service. This may include gc tuning if your service uses java.         Who Might be the First SRE?   Margaret Hamilton, working on the Apollo program on loan from MIT, might be the first SRE.      The codebase consisted of a program named P01 which wiped out navigation data. If this program was run by mistake during a real mission, it would have caused major issues.   With an SRE’s instincts, Margaret submitted a program change request to add special error checking code in the on­board flight software in case an astronaut should, by accident, happen to select P01 during flight.   But this move was considered unnecessary by the “higher-ups” at NASA: of course, that could never happen! So instead of adding error checking code, Margaret updated the mission specifications documentation to say the equivalent of “Do not select P01 during flight.”   During midcourse on the fourth day of flight of Apollo 8 mission with the astronauts Jim Lovell, William Anders, and Frank Borman on board, Jim Lovell selected P01 by mistake—as it happens, on Christmas Day—creating much havoc for all involved. This was a critical problem, because in the absence of a workaround, no navigation data meant the astronauts were never coming home.   Thankfully, the documentation update had explicitly called this possibility out, and was invaluable in figuring out how to upload usable data and recover the mission, with not much time to spare.   The change request to add error detection and recovery software to the prelaunch program P01 was approved shortly afterwards.          ","categories": ["sre"],

A time quantum is associated with the algorithm. Each process gets CPU for some units of time which is decided by time quantum value and then again enter ready queue if they have burst time remaining.   The processing is done in FIFO order.   If you want to understand more about round robin algorithm with example, watch the below video.     Implementing SRTF Algorithm in C++   Input      Number of processes   Arrival time of each process. If all process arrives at the same time, this can be set to 0 for all processes.   Burst time of each process   Time quantum   Output      Start Time(ST), Completion Time(CT), Turnaround Time(TAT), Waiting Time(WT) and Response Time(RT) for each process.   Average turnaround Time, average waiting time and average response time.   Throughput and cpu utilization.          Algorithm      Stable sort the processes in order of arrival time in ascending order.   We will be using a FIFO queue to implement this algorithm   We will first push the first process from the sorted list into queue.   We will use a array to check if the process is in the queue or not.   Keep track of the time using a variable - current_time   If the process is getting CPU for the first time, record its start time as current_time.   Give quantum unit of time to the process that is at front in the queue and pop this process from the queue.   If the burst time of this process becomes 0, calculate CT, TAT, WT and RT for it.   If some process has arrived when this process was executing, insert them into the queue.   If the current process has burst time remianing, push the process into queue again.   If the queue is empty, pick the first process from the list that is not completed.   Keep doing this till all processes are completed.

The process that has least burst time gets the CPU first.   The processes gets serviced by the CPU in order of their burst time in ascending order.   SRTF is preemptive. A process that is running on the CPU can be removed if a new process arrives in ready queue with lower burst time than current process.   SRTF is basically preemtive version of SJF.

        "title": "Difference and Similarities Between Devops and SRE",
        "excerpt":"   In my previous post, I discussed about what is site reliability engineering, how SRE differs from sysadmins and what are the responsibilities of a SRE. In this post, I will focus on highlighting similarities and differences between DevOps and SRE. Is DevOps the same as SRE? You will hear a lot of people asking this question. I hope that this post helps you in finding the answer for it.     What is DevOps   DevOps was formed by combining words “development” and “operations”. As the name suggests, it aims at bridging the gap between the development team and the operations team. In my last post, I discussed the sysadmin approach to service management and what are the disadvantages of using such approach. The incentives and goals for the development team and operations team are quite different. Developers want to push new features quickly to the customers whereas an operation engineer is responsible for keeping the services healthy and stable. Since around 70% outages are caused by some change in code or config, their goals start conflicting.   DevOps is more of a culture or a philosophy which aims at better collaboration between the developers and the operations team, automation of manual tasks and implementation of continuous delivery and continuous deployment.          Key Pillars of DevOps Philosophy      Reduce organizational silos            Conflicting goals for developers and operators       Can be very bad for the organization       Can be reduced by increasing collaboration between development team and operations team           Accept failure as normal            Operation team focused on keeping the systems stable       Failure of a service in production was seen as negative by the organization       Find the operator/developer who made the mistake and punish them       Focus on reliable testing, fast detection and recoveries from failures           Implement gradual changes            Remember, 70% outages are caused by a code or a config change       Pushing 1000 new lines of code at once vs pushing it in 10 separate deployments. Which one is better?       If failures happen, very tough to detect the cause using first approach       Make gradual change, test it and have rollback mechanism       Use change management approaches like continuous integration(CI) and continuous deployment(CD)           Leverage tooling and automation            Developers should be able to deploy changes directly to production.       In traditional approach, this was being handled by the operators       Change management approaches like CI/CD require specific tools(git, jenkins, kubernetes etc.)       Toil reduction should be an important goal for DevOps       Installing a specific package manually on 100+ servers vs using a tool to automate it?       Watching services graphs manually vs setting up alerts on top of graphs?           Measure everything            How do you know whether the first four pillars were implemented correctly in your organization?       Without data, the efforts will go into waste.       How long does it take from submitting code changes to deployment?       How often do the failures happen for different services?       How long does it take to recover from failures?       How many people are using your service? Are your users increasing or decreasing?                  What is SRE   Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a term (and associated job role) coined by Ben Treynor Sloss, a VP of engineering at Google.     SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team - Ben Treynor, founder of Google’s Site Reliability Team    If you think of DevOps as a philosophy and an approach to working, you can argue that SRE implements some of the philosophy that DevOps describes. SRE follows a set of practices to implement the principles of DevOps.          How SRE implements DevOps Principles      Reduce organizational silos            A SRE uses software engineering approaches to solve operations problem       A SRE should at least do 50% engineering work       Sharing ownership of services along with the developers       SREs use the same tools that developers use and vice versa       SREs are also from computer science background       Collaboration between SREs and developers           Accept failure as normal            SREs do not aim for 100% availability for a service       Product development team and SREs select an availability target for the service       This is called Service Level Objective(SLO).       Availability target - 99.99% implies Error budget - 0.01%       Error budget can be used to push new features quickly       If failure happens, conduct blameless postmortem and ensure that the issue doesn’t happen again.           Implement gradual changes            Reducing cost of failures       Deployment approach : Staging -&gt; Canary -&gt; Production       Canary is pushing new code changes to a few production instances       Rollback mechanism to minimize the impact of failures       Quickly detect problems with the help of monitoring           Leverage tooling and automation            Eliminating toil is one of important responsibilities of a SRE       if a machine can perform a desired operation, then a machine often should.       A SRE should spend less than 50% of their time on operational work.           Measure everything            Monitoring the stability and health of the service using dashboards       Setting up and tuning alerts to know about failures and recover fast       Measuring the toil       Measuring SLOs                  Similarities between DevOps and SREs      Both try to bridge gap between development team and the operations team   Both share ownership of service with the developers   Both believe in implementing gradual changes and follow change management approaches like CI/CD   Automation is an integral part of job for both   Measurement is absolutely key to how both DevOps and SRE work.   Both accept failures as normal and practice blameless postmortem   Difference between DevOps and SREs      Philosophy vs Implementation   What needs to be done vs How it needs to be done   Business oriented vs Service oriented   Delivering infrastructure for services vs performance and reliability of services   SRE believes in the same things as DevOps but for slightly different reasons   CI/CD - supporting because of business use case vs supporting for increasing reliability          ","categories": ["sre"],

        "title": "Zombie and Orphan Process in Operating System",
        "excerpt":"   In this post, we discussed process creation and it’s lifecycle.     A process begins its life when it is created. A process goes through different states before it gets terminated. The first state that any process goes through is the creation of itself. Process creation happens through the use of fork() system call, which creates a new process(child process) by duplicating an existing one(parent process). The process that calls fork() is the parent, whereas the new process is the child.   In most cases, we may want to execute a different program in the child process than the parent. The exec() family of function calls creates a new address space and loads a new program into it.   Finally, a process exits or terminates using the exit() system call. This function frees all the resources held by the process(except for pcb). A parent process can enquire about the status of a terminated child using wait() system call. When the parent process uses wait() system call, the parent process is blocked till the child on which it is waiting terminates.             Possible States for Parent Process after creating the child      The parent process waits for the child process. This can be done by invoking wait() system call by the parent process. The parent process then transitions from running state to waiting state.   The parent process doesn’t wait for the child process and executes along with the child.            The parent keeps on executing some other code along with the child. The parent terminates after the child process.       The parent process gets killed before the child completes its execution.           What happens when a parent process waits for the child process   pid = fork(); // Both child and parent will now start execution from here. if(pid &lt; 0) {    //child was not created successfully    return 1; } else if(pid == 0) {    // This is the child process    // Child process code goes here } else {    // Parent process code goes here    wait(NULL); }          Reaping the child process by the parent process      The wait() system call suspends execution of the calling thread until one of its children terminates.   The parent process will be suspended or it will enter into a waiting state after invoking wait() system call.   When the child terminates, the kernel sends SIGCHLD signal to the process and by default the parent process ignores this signal.   Even after the child process terminates, the process control block of the child process still remains in main memory.   But when a parent is waiting for the child process using wait(), the parent gets the status of the child when it gets terminated and asks the kernel to clean the PCB of the terminated child. This is also called reaping the child process.   To summarise it, when a parent process uses wait() system call, the process control block of the child process gets cleaned after it terminates.   What happens when a parent process doesn’t wait for the child process and executes along with it   In this case, we are assuming that the parent process terminates after the completion of the child process.      In this case, when the child process terminates, SIGCHLD signal is sent to the parent process by the kernel.   The SIGCHLD signal is ignored by the parent process by default and the process control block of the child process remains in the main memory.   This PCB of a child is wasting the precious main memory space since the process has already terminated.   Zombie Process   Zombie process is that process which has terminated but whose process control block has not been cleaned up from main memory because the parent process was not waiting for the child. If there are a large number of zombie processes, their PCBs IN WORST CASE can occupy the whole RAM.            What happens when a parent process terminates before the completion of the child process   Orphan Process   Orphan process is a process that doesn’t have a parent process. This can happen when the parent process terminates due to some reasons before the completion of the child.   What happens with a orphan process   Reparenting   An orphan process gets a new parent. The kernel detects that a process has become orphan and tries to provide a new parent to the orphan process. In most cases, the new parent is the INIT process, one with the PID 1. The new parent waits for the completion of the child(orphan process) and then asks the kernel to clean the PCB of the orphan process.          What happens to zombie processes when its parent terminates   Assume that a process created multiple child processes and then didn’t use wait() system call. So, all child processes will become zombie after they terminate. Now, what happens to these zombie processes when the parent process terminates?   Zombie processes then also becomes an orphan process. Their PCB still exists in the main memory and they also do not have a parent. These zombie process turned orphan process will then get reparented. The new parent will then collect their status and ask the kernel to clean their PCB.   Adverse affects of zombie processes   Fork() Bomb   int main() {    while(1)        fork();        return 0; }      The above program will create an infinite number of zombie processes as the parent is not waiting for the child process.   Number of PIDs is limited in the operating system. Once all PIDs are taken by the zombie process, no new process can be created.   Since no new process can be created, one cannot even run a command on the command line.   The only option to recover from a fork() bomb is to reboot the system.            Code for Zombie Process   #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; int main() {    int pid = fork();     if (pid &gt; 0) {        // Parent process code        sleep(60);    }    if(pid == 0) {        //child process code            exit(0);    } }         Code for orphan process   #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; int main() {          int pid = fork();     if (pid &gt; 0) {        // parent process code        exit(0); // Parent terminates before the child process    }    if(pid == 0) {        // child process code        sleep(60);    }      return 0; }          ","categories": ["operating system"],

        "title": "Invest In What You Know - Applying Peter Lynch Ideology to Indian Stock Market",
        "excerpt":"       Invest In What You Know Approach   Peter Lynch coined the famous investing ideology – “Invest in what you know”. As the manager of the Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments between 1977 and 1990, Lynch averaged a 29.2% annual return, consistently more than doubling the S&amp;P 500 stock market index and making it the best-performing mutual fund in the world. During his 13 year tenure, assets under management increased from $18 million to $14 billion. When he ran Magellan, he says, one of every 100 Americans was invested in it   Lynch got a lot of ten bagger ideas from buying stocks whose products he and his wife and children used frequently and liked them. How Peter Lynch’s wife Carolyn helped him spot a six bagger stock.      L’eggs is the perfect example of the power of common knowledge. In the early part of that decade, before I took over Fidelity Magellan, I was working as a securities analyst at the firm. I didn’t find L’eggs in my research, my wife found it by going to the grocery store. It was easy enough to find out that L’eggs was made by Hanes and that Hanes was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Once Carolyn alerted me to Hanes, I did the customary research into the story. The story was even better than I’d thought, so with the same confidence as the fireman who bought Tambrands, I recommended the stock to Fidelity’s portfolio managers. Hanes turned out to be a six bagger before it was taken over by Consolidated Foods, now Sara Lee.    I will try to apply Peter Lynch’s approach to investing to Indian Stock Market. I will try to list down the companies whose products we use in our day to day life and are listed in the stock market.
